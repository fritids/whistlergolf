This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace.
Paragraphs can be on one line (or many), and can drone on
for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](http://warpedvisions.org), 
and a literal .  Now some SimpleLinks, like 
one to google (autolinks to are-you-feeling-lucky), a test 
link to a Wikipedia page, and a CPU at foldoc. 

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`.

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

Some horizontal rules ...
