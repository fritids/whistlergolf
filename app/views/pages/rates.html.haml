%p At the Whistler Golf Club we pride ourselves in being the most accessible course in B.C. Whether you are a low handicapper trying to beat our course record or a mom and dad that want to play 5 holes in the evening with your kids, we've got a green fee rate and a tee time for you. If you don't see a program that fits your schedule, please call our Sales Manager and he will custom design a green fee rate for you.
